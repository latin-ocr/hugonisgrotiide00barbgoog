Afris: In caatmb st ipsi piendam soecnlaribns militantes,
scd veri ot spirituales Dei milites, dnm diabolum Christi
consessione prosternant, palmas Domini et coronas illustres
passione meruerant. Et hinc apparet quid de militia sense·
rit communitas Christianorum, etiam priusquam imperatores
Christiani essent.

4 capitalibus judiciis ⁷si non libenter interfuerunt Chris
tiani illis temporibus, haud mirum videri id debet, cum ple-
rumque de Christianis ipsis* esset judicandum: adde quod et
in ceteris rebus leges Romana duriores erant, quam lenitas
Christiana patiatur: quod vel solo cSilaniani Senatusoonsulti
exemplo satis patet. Postquam vero Constantinus Christianam
religionem et probare, et promovere coepit, non ideo desierunt
capitalia supplicia Imo ipse ‘Constantinus inter alias leges
de parricidis culeo insuendis legem tulit, quae extat Codice
Titulo de iis qui parentes vel liberos occiderunt; quanquam toson- -
alioqui in suppliciis exigendis mitissimus fuerit, ita ut ab his-
tor-icis noa paucis reprehendatur dnimiae lenitatis nomine.

Ignatius, tro African Christians, says, lton sonnerly enred in tto
arrniss os mon, bnt being trus atad spiritual acidiora of (lod, they oner-
throw tto davil by the confession ostiarias, and by their suffering obtained
as their savard, the points and immortol crotone pinon by their divine
Maater. And hence it appears what the Christian community thought
oi a soldier's profession, even before the emperors were Christiana.

4 That the Christiana at that time did not like to be present at
capital punishments, ought not to seem strange, since Christiane were
often the subjecte oi such punishments. Add to this that the Roman
lars were too harah to agree with Christian kindness, as the Silenian
Lar may serre to shew*. But after Constantino had begun to favour
and encourage the ChrIstian religion, capital punishments were still
not discontinucd. Constantine himself established a capital punishment
of a peculiar kind ior parricidas and child-murderers; though in other
respecta very mereiful, so that he was blamed by many for his excessivo
lenity. Also he had in his army many Christiana, as history teaches
