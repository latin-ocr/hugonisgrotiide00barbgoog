xiv EDITOR’S PREF'AGE.

remark, that there would be little use in a writer on this
subject stating, as the Rights of War, Rules which never
have been observed nor acknowledged in any actual war
up to the present time. Killing, taking prisoners and
making capturas, besieging towns, and the like, are of the
essence of war: and these are inevitably violent and
painful inflictione. If at any time, the rules of such prac-
tices have been harsher than they now are, wc may say
that such Rules were the Rights of war in barbarous and
ferociens times: but even in such times, those Rights
imposed a certain restraint upon the vict0r; as for instance,
the Right of making the conquered slaves, presented his
taking their lives. Thatsuch Rightsare often morally wrong,
Grotius himself repeatedly urges. The term Rights, like
the term Natural Low, of which 1 have just spoken, may
mean, either that which is secured to men by existing
Rules, in every society, however rude; or that which it

ought to be the aim of the most humane and picus men to

secure by Rule, as the best condition of society. But this
latter is not an ordinary nor convenient sense of the sub·
stentivc Rights. If we were to adopt it, we should have
a difficulty in establishing the Right of killing men at all
for no crime; and therefore, there could be no Rights of
War.

The translation may perhaps be welcome, even to the
classical scholar, for Grotius's style ia not only very con·
cise and pregnant, but also full of expressions borrowed
from the jurists and the schoolmen. But as thc text will
sufficiently explain these, Ι have not thought it necessary
to translate the Notes, which besides, for the most part,
refer to the quotations only.

There have already been published at least three trans-
lations of Grotius’s work in English, besides a small and
worthless abridgement, published in 1654 by Ο. Β. (i. e.
