XVIII. Est et acquirendi modus, inter eos qui juris
gentium vocantur, per genituram animantium: qua in re
yquod a Romanis et aliis quibusdam gentibus est statutum, ut
partus ventrem sequatur, neu est naturale, utsupra diximus,
nisi quatenus plerumque pater ignoratur. Atei probabili
ratione de eo construet, eur non partus ex parte adeum per-
tineat nihil potest afferri. Nam et patrie partem essequod
nascitur certum est Plusne vero de patre, an de matre ha·
beat, tinter Physicos disputetur. Plutarchus ea dere sicdis· cmo rm
serit. ἠ φύσις μΙὙνυσι dcci τῶν σωματων ἡμᾶς, ἵν ’μὲξ

Natural Law. and that what they ullege is not uuirersally applicable,
appears by the exception, admitted by themselves, of limitato land.
The river enriches some, lmpowerishes others, es Lucan says.

XVII. What they further say, that ewen a public read [passIng
along the river-bank] doee not bar the right of alluvium, Is a doctrine
for which therela no natural reason 3 except the prirate land be bound

XVIII. There ΙΙ another mode of acquisition, amougst those

which that which-has been ruled by the Romans and some other
nations, thet the offspring follows the mother (as to property) is not

tainty concerning him, no reason could be assIgned why the offspring
should not belong partly to hIm. For that what is born is part of
