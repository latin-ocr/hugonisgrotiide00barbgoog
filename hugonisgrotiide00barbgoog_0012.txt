savage view which derives law and justice from mutual sear,
had not been prominently put lorwards in that period, as it
was soon afterwards by Hobbes; and Grotius, in debating
the question, is driven ιο seek the opponents of bis wider
and humaner morality, in the ancient world, among the Gre-
cian sophists. But the miseries arising from unregulated war
pressed upon his thoughts with present und severe reality3
for the Thirty Ycars' War had long been revaging Europe.
To this spectacle he himself ascribes the origin of his work.
He says (Proleq. Art. 28), “I saw prcvuiling throughout
the Christian world a license in making war, of which even
barbarous nations would have been ashamed3 recourse

when arms were once taken up, all reverence for divine
and human law was thrown away; just as if men were
thencesorth authorizcd to commit all crimes without re·
straint.” The sight of these atrocitics had led many men,
be says, to hold all war ιο be urrlawful to Christians3 but

be, more temperately, thought that the remedy was to
bring it about that war itseli should be subject ιο rules of
humanity and decency. And he adds, that hc conceived
himself in some degree prepared for such a task by the
practice of jurisprudence in his own country; and hoped,

that, though unworthily ejectcd from that country, which
had been honoured by so many of his works‚ he might
still promote the science by the labours of his pen.

He cluims (Prohy. 30), ιο be the first who had reduced
Internutional Law to the form of an Art or Scicncc. Nor
do I conceive that this claim goes beyond his due: thoughI
am aware thot certain writers have been recently brought to
light and pointed out as his “ Precursors·.” The Precursors
thus newly brought into notice are Johannes Oldendorp,
