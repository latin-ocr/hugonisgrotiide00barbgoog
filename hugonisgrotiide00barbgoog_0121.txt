sed et in ahos facinorosos¹ mus-pata apparet, non modo apud
populos extraneos, sed apud ipsos pia doctrinae alumnos,
Gen. xxxviii. 24.

7 Nimirum conjectura divina voluntatis, ipsa naturali
ratione adjuvante, a similibus ad similia processerat, ut quod
in homicidam constitutum erat, in alios quoque eximie no-
centes uon iniquum rideretur. Sunt enim quadam, ques vitm
