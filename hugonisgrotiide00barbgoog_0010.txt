tion in the Laws of Nations, it has, in that department

also, been always regarded as a primary work. It soon
gave rise to Puliendorfs Treatise On tha Laws of Nature
aad Natioas, and to other books of the same kind; of
which some, like our own Rutherforth's Coarse of Lectores

Several objections have, however, been made to the

authors quoted, being retained in ,the translation, the
render can, if he chaonas, pass to the passages adduced,
which he will find on the same page. The translation is
thus rather a selective than an abridged translation; for
the didactic and argumentative parts arc, in general, so
