PROLEGOMENA. lxv

dam generaque ipsi visum est modo delineavits multos vero
et nobilium et frequentium controversiarum locos ne attigit
quidem.

39 Nos ne quid tale indictum abiret, operam dedimus, Vl·
indicatis etiam dijudicationnm fontibus, unde facile esset etiam
si qnid omissum a nobis esset definire. Superest ut quibus
ego auxiliis et qua eura hanc rem aggressus sim breviter ex·
ponem. Primum mihi cara haeo fuit, ut eornm quae ad jus wts-
naturae pertinent probationes referrem ad notiones quasdam hssfffm
tam certas, uteas nemo negare possit, nisi sibi vim inferati. '‘mm'‘
Principia enim ejus juris, si modo animum reete advertes, per
se patent atque evidentia sunt, ferme ad modum eorum quse
sensibus externis percipimus; quiet ipsi bene conformatis
sentiendi instrumentis, etsi cetera necessaria adsint, non fal-
lunt. idco in Phoenissis Euripides sic loquentem facit Poly· venosa
nicen, cujus aperte justam vult fuisso oausam: Μ’

causes for which a war isdenominated just or unjust, Ayala has not
so much as touched upon: Gentilis has indeed described, after his
manner, some of the general heads 3 but many prominent and frequent
casea of controversy he has not even touched upon.

39 We hare been careful that nothing of this kind be passed
over in silenee; having also indicated the sources from which wo do·
rire our J'udgments, so that it may be easy to determine any ques·
tlon that may huppen to be omitted by ua. It remains now that 1
briefly explain with what aids, and with what care, I undertoolr this
work.

In the first place, it was my obJect to refer the truth of the things
which belong to Natural Law to some notione, so cemain, that no
one ean deny them, without doing violence to his own nature. For
tho principles of such Natural Law, if you attend to them rightly,
are of themselves patent and evident, almost in the same way aa
things which are peroeived hythe external aensesr which do not
deceive us, if the organa are rightly disposed, and if other things
necessary ars not wanting. Therefore Euripides inhia Phoenr'esoe
makes Polynices, whose cause he would have to be represented ma·
nifestly J'nst, express himself thus:

1 speah not things hurd to be understood,

But sach as, founded on the rnles of good
And just, are known aliha to learn’d and rude.
