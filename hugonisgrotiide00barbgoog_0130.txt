bb Art BELLARE UNQUAM JUSTUM SIT. ' [Lm. 1.

Jesum a se distinguit praeceptorum discrepantia (quanquam
quae generalius et confusius, et rudimentorum· more a J oanne
sunt indicata, eadem diserte tradidit Christus vera lux) sed eo
qnod J esus esset promissus ille Messias, Actor. xix. 4; J oan. i. 29.
rex scilicet regni scelestis, qni daturus esset in se confidentibus
vim Spiritus Sancti, Matt. iii. 11; Marc. i. 8; Luc. iii. 16.

6 Quartum hoo est argumentum, quod mihi ponderis
non exigui ridetur: Si tollatur jus capitalium suppliciorum,
et armis cives tuendi adversus latrones ac praedones, maximam
inde secuturum scelerum licentiam et qussi diluvium malorum,
ucurn nnnc qnoque constitutis judiciis segre reprimatur impro-
bitas Quare si mens Christi fuisset, talem rerum statum,
“ qualis auditus nunquam fuerat, inducere, hauddubie verbis
quam maxime disertis ac specialibus edicendum ei fuerat, ne quis
decapite judicaret, nequis arma ferret3 quod secisse nusquam
legitur: nam quae adferuntur, aut valde sunt generalis, aut
obseura. Docet autem ipsa aequitas et communis ratic, non‘
tantum verbs generalia contrahi, et ambigua commode expli-
cari, sed et a proprietate usuque recepto verborum discedi

the difference of their precepta, (though what is indicated in a more
general and confused and rudimentery manner by John, Christ, the true
light, delirans clearly‚) but by Jesus being tho Messish that was ιο
como, Acts xix. 4, John i. 293 that is, the king of the kingdom of hea-
¹ren, who was to gire the Holy Spirit to them that believed on him,
Matth. iii. ll. Mark i. 8. Lutatium.

6 (4) In the fourth place there is this argument, which appears
temeto have nc small weight. If the right ot inflicting capital
punishmente, and of defending the citizens by arms against robbers
and plunderers, was taken away, then would follow a vast licensa of
crime and a deiuge of evils3 since eren now, while criminal jndg-
ments are administered, violence is hardly repressed. Wherer'ore if
the mind of Christ had been ιο induce such a state of things as never
was heard of, undoubtedly he would have sot it forth in tho clearest
and most special words, and would hare commanded that none should
pronounoe a capital sentence, none should wear arms: which we no-
where read that he did: scr what is adduced to this effect is either
very general or obscure. Equity and common senso teach us that,
in order to avoid that sense oi passages which would lead to ex·
treme inconveniences, we may limit the range of generrd termo, and
explain ambiguities, and eren depart in sorno degree from tho pro·
