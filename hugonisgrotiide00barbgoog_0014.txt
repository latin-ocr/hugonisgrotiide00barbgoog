himself admits, over the public mind of Europe, in terms
of unmingled depreciation, without having done more
than glnnced at some of its pagos, is an extraordinary
symptom of that tendenoy towards prejudices, hasty but

cast of his writings. That in the work of Grotius we see
everywhere traces of the juristical training of his mind, is
