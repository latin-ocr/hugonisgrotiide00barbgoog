Clement Barksdale, accordingthatts). William Evats pub·
lished 0 translation (infolio) in 1682, 111 which an attempt
was made (not very happily,) tc improve the work, by intro·
ducing Grotius's Notes, and other matter, 11110 the text.

Quotations so collected are often confused and imperfect,

lance and felicity‚ with which Barbeyrac has detected,
traced 10 their origin, and rectified, such mistakes as Gro-
