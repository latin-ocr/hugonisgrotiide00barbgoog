timis aequandi reperta est, per curia oblationem, aut subse·

lium est in Jacobi filiis, qui adaequati a patre sunt liberarum
mulierum filiis, et aequis partibus hereditatem creverunt

pactione, ¹¹ut qui ex conjugio nati sunt, alimenta sola habeant,
ant certe excludantur a praecipua hereditate. Oonjugium

3 On the other hand, it may happon, not only by law bnt by com-
paot, that children born in marriage may receive aliment alone, er at
least may bo excluded from the principal inhcritance. A marriage con·
tracted on such a compact, even with a free woman, the Hebrcws called
concubinage 3 such was the marriage of Abraham with Keturah, whoee
children, like Ishmael the son of Ilagar, received certain gista er lega-
cies‚ but did not succced to the inhcritance of their father. Such is
the marriage which is called mergorpube: and not very different from
this is the law of second marriages among the Brabanters: for the
lauded property which existed when the former marriage was dissolved
pasees to the children of the first marriage.

IX. 1 Whero there are no children to whom the succession may
naturally fall, tho case is loss claar; nor is there any point in which
Laws are more various. Tho whole variety however may be referred
mainly to two sourccs; one of which respecto the proximity of degree,
the other directe thc property to return to the quarter from which it

mothcr’s to the mothcr's. We lind it necessary ιο malea distinction be-
tween the property of the father and grandfather, (as it was expresacd
in the formula* in which tho prodigal was intordictcd from the con.
