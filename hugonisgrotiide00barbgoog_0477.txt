variety ιι ιίιιιιιιιιιιιι, ιιι ιιι ιι those thIngs thch must be left
ιο ιιι judgment ιι assir man, so isit often defined by the civil Law.
Thus in Helland land is held ιι be derelict, if ithus been undar water
ιιι ten years, ιιι ιιιιι ιιι no sIgns ιι ιιιιίιιιιίιι ιι possession:
and in this case we reasonably accept ι mle which the Romans reject;
that if you can do nothing else, you may be supposed to retain pos-
session by dshIng orer it. So priores wore aecnstomed to appoInt ι
time within which the ancient possessore were bound to free their lands
from water: and ιι they did not ιι this, warning was giren, ιιιιι to
those who had mortgagcs upon the land, next to those who had jans-
diction, either civil only, or orimInal also; and if all these parties were
behindhand in doing what the law required, the whole right ιι the
property passed to tho prinoe: and he either drcined the lands him·
aelf, and added them to his patrimony, or gare them to others to be
drained, retaiuing ι part ιι ιιι profit.

XI. Concerning alluvium, that is, the addition ιι particles which
cannot be claimed by any one, because it is unknown whence they
come, (ιιι otherwise tho part would not, by Natural Law, change its
owner,) it should be considered as ιιιιιίι ιιιι this also belongs to the
peoplo‚ if the people hove assumed possession ιι ιιι riser as owner,
which in ι case ιι doubt is to bo supposed3 otherwise, the property
ιι him who takes possession ιι it.
