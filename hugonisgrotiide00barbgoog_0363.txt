to obtain their liberty, that is, civil liberty; because the authority which
was gained by force may be taken away by force; and in regard to that
which was given voluntarily, they may repent and change their mind.
[But this goes too far] For authority gained at first by force may by
tacit consent receive firm right: aud tbe will exercised,either in the ori·
ginal institution of a government, or at an aster period, may be such
as to give a right which afterwards doos not depend upon the will.
King Agrippa said to the Zealots who were clamorous for liberty, It
is now out of season to demand liberty. Yon should haro fought
formerly, not to lose it. For submission is ahard lot, and it ia honour-
able to light in order to avoid it. But when a person has once been
overcome in such a struggle, if hc shake off the yoke, bc is no longer
a lover of liberty, bnt an insurgent slavo. And so Josephus himself
said3 and (lyras to the king of Armenia. [See]
