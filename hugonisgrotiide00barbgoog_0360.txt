law oi usucaption or prescription, made by the sovereign, may effect
the right oi sorereign authority, and its necessary parts, which we
have elsewhere explained (B. 1. e. iii. dri). Not a few of the Jurists
seem to think that it may, treating this question oi the sovereignty as
a matter of civil Low. We think otherwise. For in order that any
one may be bound by a law, thare is required both power and will, at
least presumed, in the author of the law. But no one can bind him-
soli in the manner of a law, that is, in the characteres a superior:
and hence it is that the authors of lawa hare the right of changing
their laws. Howerer, a person may be bound by his own law, not
directly, but by reflexion; namely as being a part of the community,
in virtue of natural equity, which requires the componant partsto
follow the analogy of the whole. So Saul put himself and his son

in many cases been increased by prescription3 and where the power oi the people
rests upon prescription, ii kings reiuse to allow it, they are involved in seditione
end troubles, like Charles 1. in England.

But Barbeyrac remarks that Grotius is speaking of Usncaption und Proesrmp·
tion as defined according to the rules of civil Law; and thot he allows in Arta
of this section, that perte oi the sorereignty may he established by usage, even in

shorter times thanthe Ciril Low requires for prescription. To which my

add, that Gronovius in another-note (⁶¹), asserta that the people

posed to give up its “most just, certain and sternat ¹

reign rights, thus going much beyond Grotimonone Ν
