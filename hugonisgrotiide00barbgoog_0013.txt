whose Primpiorwm Joria libri quinqua appeared in 1615,
1011 years before the publication 01 the work of Grotius.
But I see no reason to think that these works did more
to anticipato the work of Grotius than the works which he
himself enumerates and eritieizes, as bearing upon the
subject; especially the work of the Oxford Professor of
Law, Albericus Gentilis, De Jare Belli, llanoviae, 1598.
In this work, as Mr Hallam has observed, the titles 01 the
