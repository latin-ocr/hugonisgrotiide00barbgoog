aut jus succedendi in regnum. Et quin pro se quisque abdi·
cere possit non est dubium: an et pro liberis, magis contro-
versum, sed quod eadem distinctione expediri debet. Nam
in hereditariis qui jus a se abdicat, in liberos nihil potest
transferre: at in lineali successione patris iactum nocere non
potest liberis natis, quia simul atque existere coeperunt jus
proprium eis quesitum est ex lege: sed nec nascituris, quis
impedire non potest quin ad illos quoque suo tempore jus
pertineat ex populi dono. Neque obstat de transmissione
quod diximus: est enim ea transmissio necessaria, non volun-
taria, adparentes quod attinet. Illud interest inter natos οι
nascituros quod nascituris nondum quesitum sit jus, atque
ideo auferri iis possit populi voluntate, si etiam parentes,
quorum interest jus ad filios transire, jus illud remiserint:
quo pertinent ea quae de derelictione supra diximus.

of succeeding to it, can be abdicated. And that each person for him·
self may abdicate, there is no doubt: whether he can do so ior his
children also, is more controverted, but is to be selred by the same
distinction. For in hereditary kingdoms, he who abdicatos for himself
can transfer nothing to his children. But in a lineat succession, the act
os the father cannot be allowed to prejudice sons already born: bc-
causc as soon as they began to exist, they acquired a right by law: nor
sons not yet born, because it cannot prevent that the right should dc·
scend to them also by the gift of the people, Nor does the difficulty
of transmitting the right make any obstacle: ior the transmbsion is
necessary, not voluntary, sofar as the parents are concemed. There
is this difference between children born, and to be born: thot those not
yct born hare not yet acquirod any right, and therefore their rights
may be cut off by the will of the people, if the parents whose interest
itis that the right should pass to the sons have giren up that right:
and to this pertains what we hare said above of dereliction.

XXVII. 1 This also is made a question, Whether the reigning
king, or the people, or judgcs appointed by them, can judge concerning
the successies. And we must deny that they can pronounee a judg-
