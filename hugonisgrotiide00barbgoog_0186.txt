6 Moniti hoo exemplo, et plura occurrent, meminerimus
non omnia probare, quas a quamvis praeclare famae auctoribus
dicuntur: sepe enim tempori, saepe affectibus seruiunt, et ap-
tant τῷ πέτρῳ στάθμην. Quare danda est opere uti inhia
rebus defeesto utamur judicio, neo quae excusari magis quam
laudari possunt, temere in exemplum rapiamus, in quo per·
niciose errari solet.

7 Cum rero dictum sit, bellum publicum geri non de-
bere, nisi eo auctore, qui summam potestatem habeat, et ud
hujus rei, et ad questionis illiusque est de bello solenni
intellectum, etque adeo adalia multe, necessarium erit, quse
sit summa illa potestas, quique eam habeant, intelligeres
eoque magis, quia nostro seculo riri eruditi, quisque cx usu
magis rerum presentium, quam ex rere illud argumentum
exsequuti‚ rem per se haud expeditum multo impeditiorem

ιο treet ior peace, or ιο rush into arms For no one is bound ιο use
his Right ιο his own loss. And if Antony was judged a public enemy,
it was for the Senate and people ιο determine by whom the war was
to he conducted. So when Cassius asked the Rhodians ior soldiers ιο
help him according ιο their treaty, they replied thet they would send
them if the Senate ordered them.

6 Wurned by this and other exemples, we must recollect not to
give our approral ιο ererything which is said by authore, eren oi
great name; lor they are often governed by the time, or by partial
affections‚ and stretch their measure to their bloclr. We must endea-
vour ιο form a clear and unbiassed judgmsnt, and avoid setting up as
examples cases which ought ιο he excused rather than praised.

7 Since then it is said that a public wer must not be carried on
except by the authority oi the person in whom the Severeignty residem
it will be necessary, for the undemtandlng of this question, and in
order ιο decide other points concerning wer, that we should under·
stand what this Sororeignty is, and who has it3 end this all the more,
inasmuch as learned men, ln our time, arguing the question rather
with a riew'to some present object than according ιο the truth, hare
made a subJ'ect, in ltself not simple, still more entangled.
