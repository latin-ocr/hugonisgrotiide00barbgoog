7 (ὅ) Iu tho tiith place, it cannot be shown by any argument that
the law of Moses concoming the judgments of tribunale ceased to be
in soree before the city oi Jerusalem was destroyed, and with it, the
οιὶιιοιιοο and the hope of the Jewish ιιιιιὶοιι caused. For there is
neither in the law oi Moses any term appointed for the force oi the
law, nor do Christ or his Apostles anywhcre speak of the cessation oi
that law, except in so far as such nn erent may, as we have said, he
compreheudsd in the destruction oi the J ewish state: on the contrary,
ΡΜ] ⁸⁸5⁸ that the high priest was appointed ιο judge persons accord·
ing-to the law, Acts xxiii. 3. Christ himself, in the preface to his pre·
eapte says, that ho was uot come to destroy the law, but to iulfil ιι,
ticoh w. 17. Now in what sense this is to be understood of the
mimi ῙΜιίῦ plain enough; for the husamcnts which shadow out an
object are fultilled when the perfect form of the thing ieexhibrted·
But how can thisbe trus oi the Jndicial Law, if christ, as some hold,
took it away by his coming? But ii the obligation of the [saw 10‘
mined as long as the lewich state continued, it follows that Jews,
oren though converted to Christianity, if they were summoned 1³⁰chss
*mgissirties could not refusa, and ought not to judge otherwise i

Moses had commanded.
