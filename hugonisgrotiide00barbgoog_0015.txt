shews, satisfactorily as I conceive, that atility is a very
narrow and perverse expression for the foundation of
morality(Proley.16). And the foundation which he him-
self lays, is far broader and more philosophical (Proley. 6).
Man, he says, is an excellent animal, differing from other
animals, notin degree only but in nature3 and among his
peculiar excellencies is a desire for society, a desire for a
life spent in community with his felicia-mem and not

internal nature of his soul. Thc Riyhts which his outward
circumstances necessarily establish are recognized and
made the cardinal points cf Riqhtacss, by his inward con-
