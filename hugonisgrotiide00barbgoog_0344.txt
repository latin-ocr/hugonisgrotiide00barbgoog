crit quod fuit ante, sed novum wetere extincto: et siout si
exaruisset flumen, imperii terminus maneret medietas alvei,
qui proxime fuisset: quia mens ea populorum fuisse censenda

arcifinia putanda eunt, quia imperiis distinguendis nihil est

XVIII. Quanquam were in dubio, ut diximus, imperia
ad medietatem fluminis utrinque pertingunt, fieri tamen po-
tuit, et contigisse alicubi videmus, ut flumen totum parti uni
accederet, quie scilieet ripae alterius imperium serius occupato
jam flumine cepisset: aut quia eum in modum res pactionibus
esset definita.

changed at once, it becomes another thing. If a riveria dammed up
ιιι the upper part, and turned into a new out mede by hand, it cesses
ιο be that river3 and iu like manner ifthe river leave its old bed and
break its way by a new channel, it is not the same river ee before, but
ι new river, the old one being extinguished. And since, tf the river
had dried up, tho boundary of the territory would remain the middle
of the channel as it was just before ; ao, because the intention of the
peoples must be supposed to heve boen that their lande were to be ’
naturally divided by tho river, but that if the riserceased ιο be, then
each should hold what he had held3 therefore when the channelis
thus changed the same rule must be observed.

2 In doubtful cases, the territorias which border on the river are
to bo supposed to hare that for their bouudary: because nothing is
more auitablc for seperatIng the lande of different natione thau a river
which ia not easily crossed.

'Ibat national territorIes are defined by the rules of oper limitatio*
or aper mensuro comprehensus moro rarely happens3 end then, not
from primeral occupatiom but from concession, [or by treaty.]

XVIII. But though in doubtful cases, aa we hare said, national
territory extends to the middle of the river, it may huppen, end some-
times does‚ that the whole of the river belongs to one perty; aa when
tho second bank hee been taken possession of at a later perlod, after the
first bank and the riser had been already occupIed3 or because the
matter was se settled by compact. ·

daricss entirely artificial, us parallelo of latitude, end meridiam of which the map
of Amerina ufforde many exemplos. W. W.
