et Erasmns² nostras, wiri pacis et Ecclesiasticae et civilia aman-
tissimi; sed eo, ιιι arbitror, consilio, quo solemus, quoe in
unam partem exierunt, in alteram reflectere, ut in verum mo-
dumredeant. Verum hic ipse nimium contranitendi conatus
saepe adeo non proficit, ut obsit ctiam, quia deprehensum
facile quod in his nimium est, etiam aliis dietis intra verum
stantibus auctoritatem detrahit. Medicina ergo utrisque ad-
hibenda luit, tum ne nihil, tum ne omnia crederentur licere.

30 Simul et jurisprudentiam‚ quam antehac in muneribus
publicis quanta potui integritate exercui, nuno quod mihi in-
digne e patria tot meis laboribus ornata ejecto restabat, pri-
vatae diligentiae studio adjuvare volni. Artis sormam ci impo-
nere multi antchac destinarunt: perfecit nemo: neque vero
ficri potest, nisi, quod 'non satis curatum est hactenus, ea quae
ex constituto veniunta naturalibus recte separentur: nam
naturalia, cum semper eadem sint, facile possunt inertem col·
ligi: dicantem, quae ex constitute veniunt, cum et mutentur
saepe, et alibi alia sint, extra artem posita suni, et nliae rerum
singularium perceptiones.

approximate, men much devoted ιο peace, both ecclesiastica} and
civil: but they take this course, as Ι conceive, with the purpose with
which, when things hare been twisted one way, we bend them the
other, in order ιο make them straight. But this attempt to drire
things too far, is often so far from succeeding‚ that it does herm 3 be-
cause the exeess which it involves is easily detectcd3 and then, de·
tracta from the authority oi what is said, even within the limita of
truth, We are to provide a remedy ior both disorders 3 both ior
thinking that nothing is allowable, end that ercrything is.

30 Moreovcr, having practised jurisprudenco in public situations
in my country with the best integrity 1 could gire, Ι would now, us
what remains to me, unworthily ejected from that country graced by
so many oi my labours, promote tho seme subject, Jurisprudence, by
tho exertiou cf my private diligence. Many, in preceding times, hare
designed ιο invest the subject with the form of an Art or Science3
but no one has done this. Nor can it be done, except carc be taken
in that point which has never yet been properly attended to;-to
separate Institnted haw from Natural Law. For Natural Law, as .
being always the mma, can be easily collected into en Art: but that
which depende upon institution, since it is often changed, und is dif-
ferent in different places, hunt oi tho domuin oi ,Αιις as the per.
