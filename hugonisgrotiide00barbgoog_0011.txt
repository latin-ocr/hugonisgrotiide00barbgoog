EDITOR'S Pausias. v

far from being here abridged‚ that explanatory expres·
sions and clauses are introduced in a great number of
passages where they seemed likely to make the meaning
clearer.

It appears to me that the scheme and reasoning of
Grotius’s work are well worthy of being thus carefully
presented to the reader. I agree with a former editor,
Barbeyrao, that Grotius's learning, wonderful as it was,
was far from being the greatest of his qualifications ior

source of Jua, or Natural an;—the basis of property

recent schemes of the philosophy of morals. He is thus
favourably distinguished, not only from those who, like
