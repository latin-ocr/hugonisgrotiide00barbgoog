lxxviii PROLEGOMBNA.

nullis tamen locis ojus quod utile est ieci mentionem, sed
obiter, et ut id ipsum a justi quastione apertius distin-
goarem.

58 injuriam mihi faciet, si quis mo ad ullas nostri soordi
controversias, autumas, aut quae nascitura praevideri pos·
sunt, respexisse arbitratur. Vere enim profiteor, sieut ma·
thematici figuras a corporibus semotas considerant, ita me in
juro tractando ab omni singulari iacto abduxisse animum.

ml 59 Dicendi genus quod attinet, nolui ad rerum tractan-
muana darum multitudinem adjungendo verborum copiam fastidium

parere lectori, cujus utilitatibus consulebam. Itaque secutus
sum quantum potui concisum et docenti conveniens loquendi
genus: ut tanquam in uno conspectu habeant, qui negotia
publica tractant, ct ques incidere solent controversiarum
genera, et principia unde dijudicari possuntt quibus cognitis
facile erit ad rem subjectam accommodare orationem et quan·
tum lubet extendere.

thus difforing from Bodinus, in whom thia Art is coniounded with
Jus in our sense. In soma cases, however, I hare made mention of
the Utility of acts; but collaterally only, and in order to distinguish
that question the more plainly from the question of Right.

58 The reader will do me injustice, if he judges me to haro
written with a regard to any controversias of our own time; either
such as already exist, or such as can he ioreseen as likely to arise.
1 profess, in all sincerity, that, as mathematicians consider their
figures as abstracted from body, so did I, iu treating of Righls, ab·
straet my mind from every particular fact

59 As to the style, I was unwilling, hy adding prolixity of lau·
grrsge to tha multitude of the matters treated of, to weary the render
whomI wished to benedt. Itherefore have followed a concise and
didactio mode of treatment: that they who have to manage public
affairs, may see, at ona view, the kinds of controversias which are
wont to ariae, and tho principles by which they aro to be decidod:
this being known, it will be easy to accommodate their own dia-
courses to the subject, and to expand the discussion as much as
they plesse.

60 Ihave adduced tho words of the authors themselves, when
thoy were such as either carried with them authority, or exhibited
especial elegance: and this 1 have sometimes done in Greek authors3

''‘'but mostly, when either the quotation was short, or ono oi whiohI
despaired oi imitating the grace in a Latin translation: such a trans·
latiori I have however added in every instance, for the benedt of thoas
who find the Greek difficolt.
